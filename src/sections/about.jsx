      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I am a Software Developer with a strong interest in Robotics and Full-Stack Development.
         During my university studies, I completed coursework in robotics,
          which strengthened my problem-solving skills and technical thinking.

      </p>

      <p>
       
I worked as a Teaching Assistant for a university robotics course,
 where I supported students and collaborated closely with the course instructor.
  This experience helped me enhance both my technical abilities and my communication skills.

      </p>
      <p>
        
For my Senior Project, I independently developed a full-stack system called Smart Beauty Center,
 where I was responsible for both frontend and backend development.
  This project demonstrates my ability to work independently,
   manage a complete project lifecycle, and build practical, real-world solutions.

      </p>
      <p>
        I recently graduated and am motivated to continuously improve my skills, gain hands-on experience,
         and contribute to innovative projects in software development and smart technologies.
